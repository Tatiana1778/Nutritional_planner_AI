**Overview**: 
This project focuses on the design and evaluation of a nutrition-aware food tracking and recommendation system using data science and machine learning techniques. 
The work combines primary literature research, dataset construction, machine learning modeling, and user testing to explore how nutritional data and user health attributes can support informed dietary decisions.

**Machine Learning Models**: 
The following algorithms were implemented and evaluated:
Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier - 
  Used for classification tasks involving categorical health indicators

Linear Regression - 
  Applied to model relationships between user characteristics and calorie intake

**Usage of datasets**: 
Food nutrition dataset:
  300 food samples, organized into categories and subcategories
  Dataset base sourced from multiple public datasets on Kaggle
  Each food item includes:
    Caloric value
    Macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats)
    Minerals
    Vitamins
    Nutritional density score
  Dataset contains both numerical and categorical features

User input dataset:
  319 user samples
    Each record includes:
    Age
    Weight
    Height
    BMI value
    BMI classification
    Cardiovascular disease indicator (binary: Yes / No)
    Dietary preferences
    Average daily step count
    Daily calorie intake
  Dataset includes a combination of numerical and categorical variables
